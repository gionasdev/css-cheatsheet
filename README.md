# :rocket: CSS CHEAT SHEET :rocket:

A reference for CSS goodness.

It's quite difficult to remember everything I learned in the vast world of **CSS**. I would like to start with: Flexbox & Grid.

I chose to use <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby JS</a> because it's perfect for a static website like this project.

Check it <a href="https://gionasdev.github.io/css-cheatsheet/">here</a>.

Work in progress:
- ( In Progress ) Flexbox Layout
- ( Not Started ) Grid Layout
