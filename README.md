# :rocket: CSS CHEAT SHEET :rocket:

A reference for CSS goodness.

It's quite difficult to remember everything I learned in the vast world of **CSS**. I would like to start with: Flexbox & Grid.

I chose to use <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby JS</a> because it's perfect for a static website like this project.

Check it <a href="https://gionasdev.github.io/css-cheatsheet/">here</a>.

For the deploy on the github pages I used this guide: <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/">How Gatsby works with github pages</a>

:construction: Work in progress :construction:
- ( In Progress ) Flexbox Layout
- ( Not started ) Grid Layout
